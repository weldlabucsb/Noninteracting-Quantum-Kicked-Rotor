# Noninteracting-Quantum-Kicked-Rotor
Theoretical simulation of the noninteracting quantum kicked rotor.

For code on Lithium's quantum kicked rotor experiment.

In qkr_simulation, there are two simulations for the nointeracting quantum kicked rotor. In v1, the simulation considers a finite pulse width; this code calls the function computeBands.m in order to compute a band energies and the Bloch basis for time evolution. In v2, the simulation considers a true delta kick.
