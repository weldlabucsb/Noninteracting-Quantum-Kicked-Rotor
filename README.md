# Quantum_Kicked_Rotor
Theoretical simulations of the quantum kicked rotor.

For code on Lithium's quantum kicked rotor experiment.

In qkr_simulation, there are two simulations for the nointeracting quantum kicked rotor. In v1, the simulation considers a finite pulse width; this code calls the function computeBands.m in order to compute a band energies and the Bloch basis for time evolution. In v2, the simulation considers a true delta kick.

In qkr_gp, there are two simulations for interacting kicked rotor in 1D. delta_1D simulates a delta kick and pulse_1D simulates a finite width square pulse.
